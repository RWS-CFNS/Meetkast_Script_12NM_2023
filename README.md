# Coverage 4/5G within 12 NM zone

The aim of the project 'Coverage 4/5G within 12 NM zone' is the digitization of the North Sea. As an intern within this project, my task was to advance this goal by developing and implementing an integrated software application. The Python script created operates on the measurement setup in the Rijkswaterstaat cabinet, aiming to optimize data processing and storage, facilitate real-time data transfer, and establish a test environment with an Intel NUC.

The project is led by the Connectivity Fieldlab North Sea (CFNS), a branch within Rijkswaterstaat, with the overarching objective of digitizing the North Sea. The ultimate outcome of this project contributes to enhanced communication and measurement capabilities in the extensive maritime area of the North Sea.

The collected data will be received and processed by the backend system (https://github.com/RWS-CFNS/backend_konijn). This data will be utilized to generate a heatmap for the analysis of signal strength per provider, as demonstrated in the frontend system (https://github.com/RWS-CFNS/12NM_Frontend_EliamTraas).
